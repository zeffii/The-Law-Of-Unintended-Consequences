Introduction
============


Does every situation have a solution? Is it acceptable? is it a solution to an immediate problem or does it address deeper root causes of the situation. Have we reached a point where society thinks every problem can be solved, and every risk can be mitigated?

I would like to give a sizable list of problems which didn't get solved as intended. Some of these problems got worse, or mutated into other bigger problems. I'll leave it up to the reader to decide whether we gained a better understanding of the problem after the intervention. Must we always employ an intervention, or is it justifiable to resist the urge? What tools can we use to consider the chance of a negative outcome as a result of our intervention?
